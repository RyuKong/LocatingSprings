# Locating Springs
GEOG 4043 Final Project

## Analyze springs in northern Nebraska.

### There are three plots: a parallel coordinate plot (PCP) in white, a map of the study area, and a heatmap.

 - The points on the map are springs, and each spring cooresponds to a horizontal line on the PCP.  By hovering over these lines, you can see the corresponding spring on the map.  

 - To filter the Parallel Coordinate Plot, click and drag on any of the axes.  To remove the filter, click anywhere on that access.

 - The heatmap shows the number of springs that exist in a certain geologic layer and hydrologic group.  

 - Markers can be placed on the map by clicking.  To remove them, click on them.  To learn about this point, hover over the marker.
