# LocatingSprings
 GEOG 4043 Final Project

This is a tool that allows you to look at springs in northern Nebraska.

There are three plots: a parallel coordinate plot (PCP) in white, a map of the study area, and a heatmap.

  The points on the map are springs, and each spring cooresponds to a horizontal line on the PCP.  By hovering over these lines, you can see the corresponding spring on the map.  

  To filter the Parallel Coordinate Plot, click and drag on any of the axes.  To remove the filter, click anywhere on that access.

  The heatmap shows the number of springs that exist in a certain geologic layer and hydrologic group.
